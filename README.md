# AutomataScript
Create NFA's and run them on test inputs.

## Goals
This project aims to simplify running NFA's. Having written a program that creates and runs NFA's, I believed that having a simple text based model would be helpful for others. I also want to improve my understanding of compilers/parsers. This is essentially a Domain-Specific Language, since I'm planning on compiling this to C++ code, since I'd prefer to have this be something anyone can use, and not only people that have the same ISA that I would've decided to compile for.
